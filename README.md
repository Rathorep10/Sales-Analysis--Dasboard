# Sales Analysis- Dashboard
## Project Objective
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project aims to analyse and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.

## Solution
My interactive dashboard built an automated Python (Pandas) ETL pipeline to process 5 years of sales data, executed SQL queries to analyze regional performance and product/channel profitability, and developed interactive Power BI dashboards that uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and growth opportunities—enabling data-driven sales strategy optimization.
## About Dataset
Our analysis utilized a structured relational dataset containing months and years of transactional sales records, with key dimensions including region, product SKU, sales channel, date, revenue, and profit margins, enabling granular performance analysis and trend identification.

## Questions(KPI's)
Which regions have the highest/lowest revenue growth and profitability?

What is the YoY/MoM trend for sales and profit margins by region?

Which products (SKUs) contribute most to revenue and profit?

How do sales channels (e.g., online, retail) compare in profitability?

Are there seasonal patterns affecting revenue (e.g., Q4 spikes, summer slumps)?

Which underperforming regions require resource reallocation?

What is the correlation between discounts/pricing and sales volume?

How do customer segments (if data exists) impact regional performance?

## Conclusion
This data-driven sales analysis project successfully transformed raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence, enabling strategic decision-making for regional performance optimization. By leveraging Python (Pandas) for data processing, SQL for querying, and Power BI for visualization, we identified high-growth regions, seasonal trends, and top-performing SKUs while pinpointing underperforming areas requiring intervention. The interactive dashboards now provide sales teams with real-time visibility into revenue drivers, channel profitability, and resource allocation opportunities—turning historical data into a competitive advantage.

## Future Work
To extend this project’s impact, we will integrate real-time data pipelines for live dashboards, implement ML-driven demand forecasting, enrich insights with CRM-based customer segmentation, and deploy anomaly detection for proactive performance monitoring—transitioning from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics.
